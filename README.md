# .NET-Virtualized-Apps-Patcher

This is a universal Patcher that I coded for Virtualized Applications. Protected by KoiVM/EazVM/AgileVM.
The project idea wasn't mine at all it was by xsilent and Tobito and they released a txt that contains the tracer, uh I asked time for some infos and ended up coding my version.

## How to use


Simply you will have to clone this git to your visual studio and build it so you get the latest binaries to use.
After building open ForlaxerKoi.exe and Drag n Drop your target exe to it. Chose your options and wait for it to finish.
Profit! More details about the options would be found in ForlaxerKoi Readme file here in github, feel free to open an issue if you're struggling with something. 

## Credits

I fully coded this with the help & inspiration of these 2 awesome guys:


Tobito Github: https://github.com/TobitoFatitoNulled

xsilent Github: https://github.com/xsilent007


I'm sorry for both of em, as this projects wasnt suposed to be released until they drop their version (which is better and more advanced than mine). But due to some issues and 'leaks' that occured by a mistake I though it would be better to release it before someone do and claims it his project. This is my version of their idea. Hope you both understand guys and sorry again.


Note: May keep on pushing some fixes but I'm not going to add any new features so feel free to fork it and edit.
